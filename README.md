## Description

This is an infinite runner game made with phaserJS and compiled with Webpack. Testing is done with jestJS. The name of the game was inspired by a movie of the same name. The Maze Runner is a 2014 American dystopian science fiction film directed by Wes Ball, in his directorial debut, based on James Dashner's 2009 novel of the same name. Don't look for a maze in this game though, you won't find one! Haha...

The aim of the game is to collect as many gold pieces as possible during sixty seconds.
All gold pieces can be found on platforms which you can jump up to by hitting the spacebar - Player can jump once, twice or thrice consecutively.

More gold pieces are found on the highest platforms, so the player is encouraged to spend as much time as possible running and jumping on the high-up platforms and is penalised in lost earnings if they fall to the ground.

## Testing

This project's tests were created with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Once the project's dependencies have been installed (see Setup Instructions above), Jest will be available. **However**, the Jest Command Line Interface is only available if Jest is intalled globally:
